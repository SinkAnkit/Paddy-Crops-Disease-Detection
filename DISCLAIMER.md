# Disclaimer

This project, "Paddy Disease Classification," developed by Ankit Singh and Bhuvan Indra G, it is provided for educational and research purposes only. The software, models, and associated documentation are intended to demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques for detecting diseases in paddy leaves.

## Usage Limitations

- **Non-Commercial Use**: This project is not intended for commercial use without explicit permission from the authors.
- **No Warranty**: The software is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

- **Dataset Dependency**: The project relies on the "Paddy Disease Classification" dataset from Kaggle. Users must independently download and comply with the dataset's terms of use. The authors are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or quality of the dataset.
- **Model Performance**: The models (Custom CNN, HSV CNN, VGG16) are trained on a specific dataset and may not generalize well to other datasets or real-world conditions (e.g., varying lighting, image quality, or crop types). Users should validate model performance for their specific use case.
- **Not for Critical Applications**: The predictions provided by the models are not a substitute for professional agricultural or diagnostic expertise. Do not rely solely on this software for critical decision-making in agriculture or other fields.
